# Formula One Analysis by Kevin Ngim (Draft Submission 03/31/24)
## Introduction
Formula One is an ever growing sport as the popular Netflix series [Drive to Survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) is a big hit and with the introduction of more races in [North America](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/f1-races-hosted-us-tracks) more and more people are getting into it, I would like to take this opportunity to analyze the correlation between teams, drivers and tracks from the past 5 season from 2018 to 2023. 
## Data Selection
I will be primarily utilize provided CSV files from the internet as well as websites that consist of statistics regarding the drivers, team and tracks. To make sure these dataset is reliable I will double check with the official [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2024/races.html) Results website
## Methods
I will primarily be using the utility learnt in class to read and manipulate the data for my findings.
* `numpy`
  
In regards to visualization I will be using
* `Pandas`
* `Matplotlib`
* `SciKit`
## Questions That will be asked
What are the gap analysis between drivers, teammates and teams? 

What teams produce the highest amount of World Championship with their car?

What nationality have won the most championship?

What driver have won multiple championship and why?

Which season did regulation change impact the reigning champion the most?

Which teams were most consistent in a season? Were both drivers consistent or only one driver?

How long did it take from their rookie season to win their first race/first championship?
## Results
I will be providing visualization alongside explaination of the results in this area.
## Coding
Here I will put all my .ipynb files which will consit of the codes used for reading and manipulating the CSV datas.
