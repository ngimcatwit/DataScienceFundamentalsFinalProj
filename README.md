# Formula One Analysis Datascience Fundamentals Individual Project
## Introduction
Formula One is an ever growing sport as the popular Netflix series [Drive to Survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) is a big hit and with the introduction of more races in [North America](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/f1-races-hosted-us-tracks) more and more people are getting into it, I would like to take this opportunity to analyze the correlation between teams, drivers and tracks from the past 5 season from 2018 to 2023. 
## Data Selection
I will be primarily utilize provided CSV files from the internet as well as websites that consist of statistics regarding the drivers, team and tracks. To make sure these dataset is reliable I will double check with the official [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2024/races.html) Results website. 

The code to read and minipulate the CSV files can be found withitn the github repository [here]() using Google Collabatory

## Methods
I will primarily be using the utility learnt in class to read and manipulate the data for my findings.
* `numpy`
  
In regards to visualization I will be using
* `Pandas`
* `Matplotlib`
* `SciKit`
## Questions That will be asked
Question 1: How has the performance of teams evolved over the seasons? 

Question 2: Which drivers have shown the most consistency in race positions?

Question 3: What impact do starting grid positions have on final race outcomes?

Question 4: How do track characteristics influence race outcomes?

Question 5: What are the patterns in points allocation over the years?

## Results
Question 1: We took a look over the performance of the teams that has evolved over the season although some of the teams went through rebranding we can also see that there is three teams that has remained the not rebranded over the course of the five years that is analyzed, it was Ferrari and Mercedes and Williams

## Discussion

## Coding
Here I will put all my .ipynb files which will consit of the codes used for reading and manipulating the CSV datas.
